This is my internship at **Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), ISRO, Trivandrum**, under **Mr. Shanbhag Sushanth Suresh (Scientist/Engineer SC, CVAD/SDEG/STR).

### **SDOF System Analysis:**
I studied linear and nonlinear SDOF systems using MATLAB to solve differential equations, plotting **displacement vs. time** and **phase portraits**. Nonlinear cases involved variable stiffness, and I used **FFT** to determine natural frequencies.

### **Membrane Vibrations:**
I analyzed the free vibration of **circular, elliptical, and rectangular membranes**, comparing analytical and numerical solutions. Nonlinear vibrations due to impact loads were modeled using **Von Karman theory** and MATLAB.
